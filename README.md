Hello world! This is a bot that gives images of cheese and pasta... and more! Actually, the main focus is the subreddit-image-taking feature since for commands like the cat and dog ones, those have many subreddits to take images from.

As of now this bot is not online, and probably won't be for a couple of years though thats not stopping you from  trying and fixing my crappy code!

If you are wondering, most of the images are from reddit and I have choosen at least 50 different subreddits for all of the commands, just so you can get the variety you need/want. Honestly I'm not too sure if I have the rights (legal or not)  to show and "redistribute" them though for such a small project like this, me or you shouldn't worry about it too much.

ALSO! Just for the people that are actually going to try to use this and run it, please include me in the credits unless you edit **major** parts of the code. If not then I will probably do nothing about it if I feel like it, but if I do feel like it, I will try to get rid of the bot. Thank you :)

To run the bot itself, do:
`node index.js` and that will activate it. Of course you need to change the bot token and if you don't know how to do that just search it online and you'll get results pretty quickly.




## Features

- Can do simple moderation tasks like banning and kicking
- Can provide cat, dog, food, pasta, cute, and many other types of images!
- Pasta..............

## Installation of Requirements

To **properly** install the node modules, delete the folder provided when you clone this repo, then use something like [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Replit](https://replit.com/) and run `node install discord.js` in the terminal (while in the folder) This shound install the required modules for the basics of the bots to work.


## Other Stuff

Before I end this README.md file I do have some other stuff to say.

- This is only usable with credit in some way whatsoever, if you say that you created this (unless editing **major** parts), you  may not use it  and if you do I will try to get rid of it.

- This is written in javascript and I would recommend that you use VSC. Something that you need to install if you are going for VSC is that you need to download node.js because without it, any of the commands I just listed will not work.

- Lastly, most of this code is from stack overflow LMAOOOOOOO
