Hello world! This is a bot that gives images of cheese and pasta... and more! Actually, the main focus is the subreddit-image-taking feature since for commands like the cat and dog ones, those have many subreddits to take images from.

As of now this bot is not online, and probably won't be for a couple of years though thats not stopping you from  trying and fixing my crappy code!

If you are wondering, most of the images are from reddit and I have choosen at least 50 different subreddits for all of the commands, just so you can get the variety you need/want. Honestly I'm not too sure if I have the rights (legal or not)  to show and "redistribute" them though for such a small project like this, me or you shouldn't worry about it too much.

ALSO! Just for the people that are actually going to try to use this and run it, please include me in the credits unless you edit **major** parts of the code. If not then I will probably do nothing about it if I feel like it, but if I do feel like it, I will try to get rid of the bot. Thank you :)

To run the bot itself, do:
`node index.js` and that will activate it. Of course you need to change the bot token and if you don't know how to do that just search it online and you'll get results pretty quickly.
